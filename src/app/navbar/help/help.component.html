        Thank you for choosing to use LOL Champion Select Assistant. To use this application, select a champion on the home page. Select the proper lane and tags for the way you like to play this champion then click the "Add To Roster" button. Now look at the navigation bar at the top and select the "Roster" button. You can see your new champion has been added to your personal roster page. If you click on a champion in the Roster page, you can edit the information you previously selected. On the left side of the Roster page you'll see a "SideNav" bar. If you click on Filter, you can filter every champion on your personal roster page based on one or more tags. The next option "Add Tag" allows you to type in any tag you would like to add to your champions. Any tag added can be added to a champion and will be displayed in both the "Filter" list and the "List Tags" option. You can remove any tags you want to change or are no longer using with the "Remove Tag" option. The final option in the sidenav "List Tags" displays every tag you have entered using "Add Tag". <span style="color: #ff0000">There is a current limit of 30 user added tags and each champion can have a maximum of 6 tags</span>. The account page displays some of your accounts information and gives the user the option to unsubscribe from the website. If you choose to unsubscribe, your account will be removed and your entire roster page will be deleted.
